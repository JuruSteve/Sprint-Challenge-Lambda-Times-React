1.  PropTypes are used for typechecking. It is important to type check our data because it helps catch a lot of bugs. PropTypes make sure the data you recieve is valid, and if it is not, a warning is printed in the console.

2.  A lifecycle event in React is an event that happens at a specific time in the life of a component.(Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting)

3.  A higher order component is a component that takes in one or more components and returns another component. An HOC cannot be rendered in JSX, instead its return value is captured in variable that can be rendered in JSX.

4.  CSS-IN-JS: this approach to styling in React is useful because you can write your css styles as JavaScript objects and injecting them in your DOM elements.
    Styled-Components: This approach lets you style components individually and you can reuse those styles elsewhere in your app.
    Css: this approach lets you use external stylesheets to style your app. This keeps all your styles grouped together.
